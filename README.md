This is a weather application designed to provide users with real-time weather information.
Users can get weather report for their real time location and can also get weather information for any city by searching city name or pin cod.
I have developed using React with Vite for the frontend and Express.js for the backend, the app integrates seamlessly with a weather API to deliver accurate weather data.
